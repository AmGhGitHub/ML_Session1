1- Correlation refers to the relationship between two variables 
and how they may or may not
change together. 
2- The most common method for calculating correlation is Pearsonâ€™s Correlation
Coefficient, that assumes a normal distribution of the attributes involved. 
3- A correlation of -1 or 1 shows a full negative or positive correlation respectively. Whereas a value of 0 shows no
correlation at all. 
4- Some machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression can suffer
poor performance if there are highly correlated attributes in your dataset.

"""
1- Skew refers to a distribution that is assumed Gaussian (normal or bell curve) that is shifted or
squashed in one direction or another. 
2- Many machine learning algorithms assume a Gaussian
distribution. 
3- Knowing that an attribute has a skew may allow you to perform data preparation
to correct the skew and later improve the accuracy of your models. 
4- You can calculate the skew of each attribute using the skew() function on the Pandas DataFrame.
