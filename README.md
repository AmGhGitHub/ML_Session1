## Machine Learning Session 1
_Finally lets talk about machine learning_
**Machine learning: Using Data to Answer Question**
the above phrase can be split into two parts:
**Using Data --> Training**
**Answer Question --> Prediction**

### 7 Steps of Machine Learning
#### 1- Data Gathering
#### 2- Data Preparation
##### Put all data together and remove not useful data like duplicated data
##### Randomize the order 
##### Split the  data between training and evaluation set (80%-20%)
#### 3- Model Selection
#### 4- Training
       it is like a student learning how to drive a car
       for the case of simple classification, it is the matter of
       finding proper m & b for building the straight line of 
       y=m*x+b
       As a part of the training process, we choose some random numbers
       for weight and bias and make prediction and compare with actual 
       results, until satisfactory performance is achieved
#### 5- Evaluation
       Evaluation of the model performance against the data set that
       has never been seen
#### 6- Parameter Tuning  (Hyper parameters)
#### 7- Prediction
